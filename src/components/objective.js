My diverse background, based in video editing and the legal field, allows me to have a creative, open mind, yet be concise and detail-oriented. I am assertive in approaching problems, and can take the lead in any situation, but can also constructively take criticism to improve my performance.  I can handle high-stress environments, while maintaining a cool head and a sense of urgency in my work.  I can play the role of a team member and lead the team, both, in a successful manner. My goal is to create applications that are built on efficient and effective code.</p>
